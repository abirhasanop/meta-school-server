        "description": "Landing page relevance plays a large part in how Google Ads calculates your Quality Score. The more relevant your landing page is to your chosen keywords, the higher your Quality Score will be. When you improve your Quality Score, this helps your ads rank higher, and results in you paying less per click. When you feature relevant and interesting content on your landing page, your site visitors are more likely to share your page with others. This results in greater brand exposure for you, at zero cost."
